# Prime numbers

Why are prime numbers used in hashing functions? Because they are more likely to
produce unique values

Given a string "Samuel", you can generate a unique hash by multiply each of the
constituent digits or letters with a prime number and adding them up. This is
why primes are used

Using prime numbers results in a lower chance of collisions when generating
unique numbers to use as hash keys
