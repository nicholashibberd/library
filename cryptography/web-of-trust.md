# Web Of Trust

A public key can signed as a way of saying "I trust this key-owner" relationship. The more signings a key has the more trusted it is. 

If you get an email from someone who's key is signed by someone who's key you have signed, then you are more likely to trust the sender. 

Kind of like how link equity works in SEO.
