# RSA

Public key cryptosystem

RSA is two algorithms, one for asymmetric encryption, one for digital
signatures. They are different but share the same mathematical operation and key
format.

User creates a public key based on two large prime numbers. Prime numbers must
be kept secret

Not usually used for encrypting messages due to its slow speed. More often
passed encrypted shared keys to enable symmetric encryption.
