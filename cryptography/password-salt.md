# Password Salt

Why is the salt important when encrypting passwords? Because it protects against
the use of rainbow tables against common passwords. Rainbow tables are expensive
to create, and even if the attacker had every encrypted password and salt, and
had worked out which was which, they would still have to create a rainbow table
for every password they want to crack
