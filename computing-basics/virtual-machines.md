# Virtual Machines

Technology that encapsulates computer programs from the underlying operating
system on which they are executed. The program behaves as if it is interfacing
with the original operating system.

An application virtual machine, or process virtual machine is used to run
application bytecode portably on many different computer architectures and
operating systems.

Memory management happens at a higher level of abstraction than in physical
machines.
